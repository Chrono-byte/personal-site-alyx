        I'm a software developer/engineering student and freshman at <a class="gold">IUPUI</a>. I'm currently working on a real-time chat application from scratch using Node.js, and WebSockets. I competed in the <a class="crimson">VEX Robotics Competition</a> for 4 years as a programmer and designer. My team worked hard in the
        incredibly difficult Indiana region and managed to qualify for the State
        Championship in 2023 and fell just short of qualifying for the World
        Championship. I've been programming for 7 years and have experience with
        {" "}

        <a class="js">JavaScript</a>, and some light{" "}
        <a class="ts">TypeScript</a>{" "}
        and Python knowledge. I hope to one day work in motorsports in stage
        rally or open wheel racing.
