          Linux-based computers for {new Date().getFullYear() - 2019}{" "}
          years. I have been doing computer programming for{" "}

          &emsp;During my time in high school, I competed in the VEX Robotics
          Competition as a programmer and designer for my team. We worked hard
          in the incredibly difficult Indiana region and managed to qualify for
          the State Championship in 2023.
