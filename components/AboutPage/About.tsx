          &emsp;I'm a self-taught software developer and have worked on a
          variety of different projects since I was 12. I have used Linux-based
          computers for {new Date().getFullYear() - 2019}{" "}
          years. I have been doing computer programming for{" "}
          {new Date().getFullYear() - 2016} years and have experience with{" "}

          knowledge. I've worked on a few websites, a few Discord bots, and even
          a chat app.

          &emsp;During my time in high school, I competed in the VEX Robotics
          Competition as a programmer and designer for my team. We worked hard
          in the incredibly difficult Indiana region and managed to qualify for
          the State Championship in 2023.
