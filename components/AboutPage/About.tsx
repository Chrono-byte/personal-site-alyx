          I'm a self-taught software developer and have worked on a variety of
          different projects since I was 12. I have been programming for{" "}

          knowledge. I've worked on a few websites, a few Discord bots, and even
          a self made chat app. I'm currently working on a few projects as well
          as my degree.
