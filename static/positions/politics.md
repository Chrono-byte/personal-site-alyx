## On Elections

It's genuinely concerning how disconnected our political systems can feel from
people's actual lives. I’m convinced our local elections—and ideally, the
national ones too—would be so much more representative if we could evolve past
the antiquated first-past-the-post system. It seems like both major parties, at
every level, are operating on a different wavelength from the average American.

## On Ideologies

### Conservatism

I can appreciate that valuable ideas can come from right-wing perspectives. The
issue, particularly in the U.S., is what feels like a pervasive refusal to cede
any ground, which stifles any real potential for progress.

#### Neo-conservatives

> hold on to power. That’s what we’re seeing before our very eyes." - Rep. Greg
> Stanton [(January 6th, 2021)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAQY8U6goEw)

I make a point not to dismiss entire groups, but my engagement with neo-cons
online has led me to a pretty firm conclusion: their ideology as it's practiced
now poses a significant threat to the integrity of American democracy.

#### Traditional Conservatives

At its core, traditional conservatism aims to uphold existing institutions, but
often at the cost of progress, with a focus on preserving a static social
hierarchy. It champions individual freedom and free markets, yet in its pursuit
of the status quo, it frequently supports policies that limit personal autonomy
for many.

The ideology tends to prioritize the interests of the wealthy elite over the
working class and marginalized groups. Policies like tax cuts for the wealthy
and industrial deregulation often concentrate wealth and power. There’s also a
consistent resistance to social and cultural evolution—like the push for greater
equality. This can perpetuate harmful systems of oppression by opposing LGBTQ+
rights, racial justice, and other progressive movements.

Finally, this focus on the past over the future can lead to an unwillingness to
address urgent challenges like climate change and systemic inequality. So, while
I understand the stated principles, the practical application often falls short
of creating a just and forward-thinking society.

### Liberalism

Liberalism is such a fascinating cornerstone of our nation's political
architecture. It’s an ideology that centers individual freedom and equality
under the law. While it's often associated with the left, its core tenets—like
the separation of church and state or representative democracy—are foundational
to our entire system.

#### Leftists

Leftism is a broad and dynamic spectrum of ideologies focused on social justice,
equality, and collective well-being, encompassing everything from social
democracy to socialism. These frameworks typically advocate for a more active
government role in redistributing wealth and ensuring social services, alongside
robust protections for workers.

From my social liberal viewpoint, I'm drawn to the way leftism seeks to address
systemic inequalities. I tend to favor a mixed economy, where the government
provides a strong regulatory framework and essential services while still
allowing for private enterprise. It feels like a pragmatic way to balance the
needs of the individual with the health of the community.

At the same time, I think it's important to critically consider the potential
consequences of some leftist policies on economic growth and individual liberty.
The argument that personal freedom should be curtailed for "the benefit of
society" is one I approach with caution. Exploring that tension between social
liberalism and more radical leftist ideas is something I find endlessly
interesting.

### Capitalism

I identify as a [capitalist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitalism), but with
some serious qualifications.

On a macro level, capitalism appears to be the most effective economic system we
have for wealth generation. I believe an economic system's primary
responsibility is to allocate resources efficiently to create the largest
possible tax base, which can then be redistributed to support those who need it
most. The problem in many Western countries, and especially the U.S., is a
fundamental failure in that "redistribution" part.

One issue I'm particularly passionate about is the privatization of publicly
funded research. Knowledge that should benefit all of society gets locked away
by corporations through patents and other ethically questionable means.

There are different models of capitalism, from
_[laissez-faire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laissez-faire)_ to
[state capitalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_capitalism). Purely
free-market systems have significant flaws—monopolies, power imbalances, a
failure to account for negative externalities. That's why I believe capitalism
must be regulated by a strong government that actively works to correct these
issues, similar to the
[Nordic model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nordic_model). It's the most
balanced and proven approach we've seen in the West.

### Populism

> “It is fatal to look hungry. It makes people want to kick you.” ― George
> Orwell, Down and Out in Paris and London

I can't get behind [populism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Populism).

It's an ideology that thrives on an "us vs. them" narrative, pitting "the
people" against "the elites." You see it on the right with figures like Trump
and on the left with certain online socialist factions. Populism is seductive
because it taps into potent negative emotions, but it's often dangerously
divorced from facts.

### Socialism / Communism

> "Truth And Good Are Values Proven To Cause Division." — Delamain
> (Cyberpunk 2077)

I find myself fundamentally disagreeing with
[socialism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialism) and
[communism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communism). I believe these systems
are inherently flawed and have historically proven ineffective at generating
prosperity and improving quality of life. The refusal by many online to
acknowledge this history is, in my view, a major source of the left's
infighting. I've seen it firsthand create divides between myself and people I
consider close friends.

For me, one of the core flaws is ironically similar to that of pure
laissez-faire capitalism: a naive assumption about human nature. It presumes
that those in power will act as perfect, selfless stewards of the system, rather
than as self-interested individuals, which is a far more common reality.

### Voting

At the end of the day, voting is crucial.

People are facing real, immediate problems that need to be solved. The most
effective way to do that is to work within the current system, build coalitions
with people who share your vision, and vote for the best possible candidates at
every single level of government. It's how we make change happen.
