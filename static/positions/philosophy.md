## My Foundational Beliefs

To engage with politics in a meaningful way, I believe it's essential to operate
from a clear set of philosophical axioms. They are the foundation that guides my
decision-making. My own framework is built from the ground up:

- **Part I: The Self**
  1. I begin with the axiom of my own existence.

- **Part II: The Other**
  1. From there, I recognize the existence of other people as equally valid.

- **Part III: Mutual Rights**
  1. I have a fundamental right to exist.
  2. Consequently, other people have an equal right to exist, free from my
     interference.

## On Violence

I am fundamentally opposed to violence as a mechanism for achieving political or
social change. It's a counterproductive tool that rarely accomplishes its stated
goals and instead perpetuates cycles of retaliation. Violence is the language of
the oppressor, not a sustainable path toward liberation for the oppressed.

### Defense of Property

This opposition to proactive violence does not, however, negate the right to
self-defense, which I believe extends to one's property under specific,
stringent conditions. I see the use of force in defense of property as
justifiable only when three critical criteria are met:

1. The ownership of the property must be legally and communally recognized.
2. All reasonable, non-violent avenues to de-escalate the situation and protect
   the property have been exhausted.
3. The aggressor is reasonably aware that their actions will be met with
   defensive force.

For instance, if someone is actively attempting to destroy your small business
or your home—assets that represent your livelihood and security—you have a right
to defend that property by necessary means.

Disagreements on this topic often boil down to a difference in underlying
values, framed as the question of whether "property can be valued over human
life." In my experience, this argument is often advanced from a position of
privilege that underestimates the profound personal sacrifice and years of labor
invested in acquiring a business, a vehicle, or even deeply meaningful personal
items. It suggests that no matter the value and sacrifice associated with one's
property, even for those living in poverty, the life of the aggressor always
outweighs it. I take issue with this conclusion. I believe it's often rooted in
a lack of empathy and a fundamental disconnect from the lived realities of the
working class, for whom property represents not just an object, but security,
stability, and years of their life's work.
