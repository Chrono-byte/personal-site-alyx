## Boiler: A TypeScript Chat Server

**Boiler** was my exploration into building real-time communication systems
using modern TypeScript and Deno. This chat server project combined WebSocket
connections for real-time messaging with REST APIs for administrative functions,
all built with a focus on extensibility and developer experience.

## Project Origins

Started in early 2022, Boiler emerged from my interest in real-time web
technologies and the desire to build something more substantial than simple
tutorials. The project served as a testing ground for:

- **WebSocket protocol** implementation
- **Server architecture** design patterns
- **TypeScript** in server-side applications
- **Deno's runtime** capabilities

## Architecture Overview

Boiler follows a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns:

### Core Components

- **WebSocket Server**: Handles real-time message broadcasting
- **REST API**: Manages users, channels, and server configuration
- **Message Router**: Directs messages to appropriate channels
- **Authentication System**: Basic user management and session handling
- **Plugin System**: Extensible architecture for custom features

### Technology Stack

- **Deno** as the runtime environment
- **TypeScript** for type safety
- **WebSockets** for real-time communication
- **HTTP/REST** for administrative operations
- **JSON** for data serialization

## Key Features

### Real-Time Messaging

The core functionality revolves around WebSocket connections that enable instant
message delivery:

```typescript
// Simplified WebSocket message handling
wss.on("connection", (ws: WebSocket) => {
  ws.onmessage = (event) => {
    const message = JSON.parse(event.data);
    broadcastToChannel(message.channel, message);
  };
});
```

### REST API Design

Administrative functions are exposed through a RESTful API:

- `POST /channels` - Create new channels
- `GET /channels/{id}/messages` - Retrieve message history
- `POST /users` - User registration
- `GET /users/{id}` - User information

### Extensibility Framework

One of Boiler's key design goals was extensibility:

```typescript
interface Plugin {
  name: string;
  init(server: Server): void;
  handleMessage(message: Message): boolean;
}

// Plugin registration
server.registerPlugin(new ModerationPlugin());
server.registerPlugin(new LoggingPlugin());
```

## Technical Challenges

### WebSocket State Management

Managing thousands of concurrent WebSocket connections required careful
attention to:

- **Connection lifecycle** handling
- **Memory management** for active connections
- **Heartbeat mechanisms** for connection health
- **Graceful disconnection** handling

### Message Broadcasting

Efficient message distribution to multiple clients involved:

- **Channel-based routing** for targeted delivery
- **Connection pooling** for performance
- **Backpressure handling** during high load
- **Message queuing** for offline users

### Type Safety in Real-Time Systems

Maintaining type safety across WebSocket boundaries presented unique challenges:

- **Runtime type validation** for incoming messages
- **Schema evolution** for message formats
- **Type-safe APIs** for plugin development

## Development Experience

Building with Deno provided several advantages:

- **Zero configuration** setup
- **Built-in TypeScript** support
- **Secure by default** permissions model
- **Modern ES modules** throughout

## Lessons Learned

The Boiler project taught me valuable lessons about:

- **Real-time system architecture** patterns
- **WebSocket protocol** intricacies
- **Scalability considerations** for chat systems
- **Plugin system design** principles
- **Deno ecosystem** capabilities

## Project Outcomes

While Boiler served its purpose as a learning platform, it demonstrated:

- **Feasibility** of TypeScript in server applications
- **Effectiveness** of Deno for rapid prototyping
- **Importance** of extensible architecture
- **Value** of real-time communication patterns

The project remains available on
[GitLab](https://gitlab.com/Chrono-byte/boiler/) as a reference implementation
for similar systems.
