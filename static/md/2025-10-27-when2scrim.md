I recently built a custom scrim/team management platform for my university's
Overwatch eSports team, [when2scrim](https://w2s.unknownhost.name). As the team
manager, I needed a tool that could handle my specific scheduling needs, so I
decided to create one from scratch. I based the design on
<a href="https://when2meet.com/" className="link font-semibold">when2meet</a>, a
popular scheduling tool, but tailored it specifically for our team's
requirements. I wanted support for recurring events, with weekly notifications,
in order to help automate the scheduling process.
