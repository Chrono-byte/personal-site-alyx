## Katana: Lightweight Prototyping Datastore

**Katana** was a focused experiment in building a minimal yet functional
datastore designed specifically for rapid prototyping scenarios. This project
explored the boundaries of simplicity while maintaining useful functionality for
development workflows.

## Project Motivation

During development work, I often needed quick data storage solutions for:

- **Prototype applications** requiring persistent data
- **Development tools** needing configuration storage
- **Experimental features** requiring data persistence
- **Learning projects** exploring database concepts

Traditional databases were often overkill for these use cases, while simple file
storage lacked structure and querying capabilities.

## Design Philosophy

Katana embraced minimalism as a core principle:

- **Single Responsibility**: Store and retrieve string arrays
- **JSON Format**: Human-readable and universally parseable
- **Zero Dependencies**: Pure TypeScript implementation
- **File-Based Storage**: No server or complex setup required

## Core Architecture

### Data Model

Katana stores data as collections of string arrays:

```json
{
  "users": [
    ["alice", "developer", "active"],
    ["bob", "designer", "inactive"]
  ],
  "projects": [
    ["web-app", "typescript", "2023-01-15"],
    ["api", "node", "2023-02-01"]
  ]
}
```

### API Design

The interface focused on simplicity:

```typescript
interface KatanaStore {
  // Create or update a collection
  set(collection: string, data: string[][]): void;

  // Retrieve a collection
  get(collection: string): string[][] | null;

  // Add a record to a collection
  append(collection: string, record: string[]): void;

  // Remove a collection
  delete(collection: string): void;
}
```

## Implementation Details

### File Management

Data persistence used JSON files with atomic writes:

```typescript
private async saveToFile(): Promise<void> {
  const tempFile = `${this.filePath}.tmp`;
  await Deno.writeTextFile(tempFile, JSON.stringify(this.data, null, 2));
  await Deno.rename(tempFile, this.filePath);
}
```

### Data Validation

Basic validation ensured data integrity:

- **Type checking** for string arrays
- **Collection name validation** (alphanumeric + underscores)
- **Record length consistency** within collections
- **File permission handling** for read/write operations

## Use Cases and Applications

### Development Tooling

Katana proved useful for:

- **Configuration storage** for CLI tools
- **Cache management** for build processes
- **Session data** for development servers
- **Feature flags** and experimental settings

### Prototype Applications

Quick prototyping benefited from:

- **User data management** in demo applications
- **Content storage** for blogging platforms
- **Settings persistence** for desktop applications
- **Offline data** for progressive web apps

## Technical Challenges

### Concurrency Handling

File-based storage required careful concurrency management:

- **File locking** mechanisms for multi-process access
- **Atomic operations** to prevent data corruption
- **Conflict resolution** strategies for concurrent writes
- **Performance considerations** for high-frequency operations

### Data Type Limitations

The string-only constraint presented interesting challenges:

- **Type serialization** strategies for complex data
- **Query limitations** due to lack of native types
- **Indexing strategies** for performance
- **Migration patterns** for schema evolution

## Lessons Learned

### Minimalism Benefits

Building Katana reinforced the value of:

- **Focused scope** leading to reliable implementations
- **Simple APIs** enabling easy integration
- **Clear constraints** driving creative solutions
- **Rapid iteration** through minimal complexity

### Prototyping Insights

The project revealed important prototyping principles:

- **Start simple** and expand based on real needs
- **Prioritize developer experience** in tooling
- **Consider persistence** early in development
- **Balance flexibility** with useful constraints

## Project Evolution

Katana served as a foundation for exploring:

- **Query languages** for structured data access
- **Indexing mechanisms** for performance optimization
- **Replication strategies** for data durability
- **API extensions** for advanced use cases

## Current Status

While Katana was a prototype that fulfilled its experimental goals, it
demonstrated:

- **Feasibility** of minimal data storage solutions
- **Effectiveness** of JSON for structured data
- **Importance** of atomic operations in file storage
- **Value** of constraint-driven design

The project remains available on [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/Chrono-byte/Katana)
as a reference for simple data storage implementations.
