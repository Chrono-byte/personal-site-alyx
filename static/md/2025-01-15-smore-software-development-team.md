## SmoreSoftware: Founding a Small Development Team

**SmoreSoftware** was my venture into entrepreneurship during high school, where
I founded and led a small development team focused on creating custom Discord
bots. This three-year journey taught me about business operations, team
management, and client relationships in the competitive world of freelance
development.

projects evolved into a business opportunity as friends and online communities
requested custom bot development.
